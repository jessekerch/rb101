# Write a method that combines two Arrays passed in as arguments,
# and returns a new Array that contains all elements from both Array arguments,
# with the elements taken in alternation.

# You may assume that both input Arrays are non-empty,
# and that they have the same number of elements.

# Example:

# interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']

def interleave(arr1, arr2)
  arr1.zip(arr2).flatten
  # combined = []
  # idx = 0
  # until idx >= (arr1.size) do
  #   combined << arr1[idx] << arr2[idx]
  #   idx += 1
  # end
  # combined
end

p interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) #== [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']
