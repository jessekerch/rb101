# Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate.
# The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.

# Example:

# What is the bill? 200
# What is the tip percentage? 15

# The tip is $30.0
# The total is $230.0

puts "What is the bill? "
bill = gets.to_f

puts "What is the tip percentage? "
tip_rate = gets.to_f

tip = bill * (tip_rate / 100)
total = bill + tip

puts "The tip is $#{format("%.2f", tip)}"
puts "The total is $#{format("%.2f",total)}"
