# Alyssa noticed that this will fail if the input is 0, or a negative number,
# and asked Alan to change the loop.
# How can you make this work without using begin/end/until?
# Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.
